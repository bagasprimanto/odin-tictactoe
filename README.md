# The Tic Tac Toe project
In this project I built a Tic Tac Toe game by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, specifically exercising Factory functions and the module pattern from JavaScript.

You can:
* Start a tic tac toe game
* Restart the game when you're finished!

Try it yourself!

## What I Learned
In this project I learned the following:

* Used JavaScript module pattern to encapsulate actions
* Separate game controls and UI concerns with the module pattern
